    "- **Observational study**: A study in which characteristics of a sample selected from one or more existing populations are observed.\n",
    "    - The goal of an observational study is usually to draw conclusions about the corresponding population or about differences between two or more populations. \n",
    "    - In a well-designed observational study, the sample is selected in a way that is designed to produce a sample that is **representative** of the population.\n",
    "- **Experiment**: A study that investigates how a response variable behaves when one or more explanatory variables, also called factors, are manipulated. \n",
    "    - The usual goal of an experiment is to determine the effect of the explanatory variables (factors) on the response variable. \n",
    "    - In a well-designed experiment, the composition of the groups that will be exposed to **different experimental conditions** is determined by random assignment."
